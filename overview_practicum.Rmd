# R and the ODP

## Getting Data from the ODP

I find the best way to learn R, or any language is to start with a
problem, break it in to pieces and then start tackling from there. One
of the earliest hurdles an epidemiologist might have to overcome
involves reading data into the environment. Usually there a few options
and ways to go about this per a language. SAS and R Studio both have a
point and click gui to read-in data, and they both have options to
ingest data programmatically as well. R is generally easier to do this
because it is less strict on data type and length, but a good programmer
will generally enforce these things anyway. Today we'll be doing
something a little different, since one of the goals is to learn the
Open Data Portal, we are going to play with data that is stored on the
open web and pull it down using an Application Programming Interface or
API.

## Installing RSocrata Package

Below is a code chunk showing the installation of the RSocrata Package.
For your first time installing this, you will want to erase the \# and
run that line to install the package.

Below that is the library statement that invokes the use of that
package's functions for your workflow. We Will make heavy use of the
function, *read.socrata()*. You can see it in action below, where I pull
in publicly released CT Monkey Pox Age group data. The ODP let's users
do an API callout to pull data into memory. The URL listed there is the
unique API webaddress for that
[dataset](https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/CT_CaseReportableDisease_AgeGroup/bg8t-bfyp).

```{r installing_RSocrata, }
#install.packages("RSocrata")
library(RSocrata)

#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)



monkey_pox_agegroups <- 
  RSocrata::read.socrata(
    url = "https://data.ct.gov/resource/bg8t-bfyp.json"
  ) %>% 
  as_tibble()


print(monkey_pox_agegroups)

```

3.2-3.4, skim 3.5, 3.6, skim 3.7-3.10

## Plotting ODP Monkey Pox Data

Armed with the reading above, and the *read.socrata()* example, please
attempt to do the following:

-   Create a new .R script
-   Download the MPOX state
    [data](https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/CT_CaseReportableDisease_State/qhtt-czu2)
    using the URL "<https://data.ct.gov/resource/qhtt-czu2.json>" and
    assign it to a tibble
-   Using the ReportPeriodStart variable for the x-axis and a count on
    the y axis, please create a bar chart using ggplot2 package (which
    is part of the tidyverse package) and *geom_bar()*

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
monkey_pox_state_data <- 
  RSocrata::read.socrata(
    url = "https://data.ct.gov/resource/qhtt-czu2.json"
  ) %>% 
  as_tibble()


monkey_pox_state_data %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(reportperiodstart))

```

# DPLYR (The bread and butter of the tidyverse)

## Suggested Reading

-   [Quick Overview](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) Just read the
    overview and check out the Cheat Sheet

-   [Introduction to
    dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html) This whole
    thing is a good overview. Focusing on *filter*, *select*, *rename*,
    *mutate* and *summarise* is a good use of time though.

## Approaching a table with SAS and dplyr

SAS and R approach similar issues from different points of view. I think
both are important to know. Languages come and go, and tools can be
swapped for others, but keeping in mind how one language might tackle a
problem and then being able to apply it to novel roadblocks or new
languages is always helpful. Long story short, in public health you will
always strapped for time and/or resources, thinking critically and being
able to break a problem down into miniature steps like you would in any
language is possibly the most important lesson of all.

In general a SAS workflow might center around a few workhouse functions
with many different arguments, whereas R in the tidyverse, will focus
around smaller functions that has less options, but by doing one thing,
you can chain them together in any order.

SAS PROC FREQ is a good example, out of the box it is a handy little
function for looking at counts across groups in data. Using our
monkey_pox_agegroups table as an example you might type something like
the following in SAS:

(bear with me, my SAS is geting rusty :D)

PROC FREQ data = monkey_pox_agegroups;\
Tables agegroup;\
Run;

This would give you a count, a groupwise percent of the whole, a
cumulative count, and a cumulative percent. Not bad for a few lines. If
we try to recreate that in R using the basic dplyr verbs, it might be a
bit more verbose. However, you might not need all the extras, or as you
become more advanced and you settle into a more standard approach in
your day to day, you might try your hand at creating your own functions
and/or starting piping functions into other functions using some other
packages. It's in that sweet spot where you start getting a return on
your investment. But for now, let's use recreating proc freq as a
showcase for showing off dplyr verbs.

```{r, dplyr showcase}
#let's take a look at the table structure again

glimpse(monkey_pox_agegroups)


#base R might use the str() function instead
str(monkey_pox_agegroups) #think structure
 

#I want a table with counts of age groups, with percents and cumulative counts/percents

desired_output <- 
  monkey_pox_agegroups %>% 
  #I want my calculations done per group, in this case agegroup
  group_by(agegroup) %>% 
  #this is a counting function, works greeeat with groupby
  tally(name = "Frequency") %>% 
  #let's create a new variable
  #ungrouping because I don't want this donee pere group now
  mutate(
    Percent = Frequency/sum(Frequency) * 100, #the sum function works like the SAS one,
    #and just, like the SAS a NULL value will NULL out the entire output, unless 
    #otherwise specificed to ignore NULLs or NAs
    
    
    #lets round this, this could be neested up there, but I like readability
    Percent = round(
      Percent,
      digits = 2
    ),
    
    cumulative_frequency = cumsum(Frequency),  #cumulative sum function
    
    #nesting here as an example
    cumulative_percent = round(
      cumulative_frequency / 
        sum(cumulative_frequency) * 100,
      digits = 2
    )
  )

desired_output
```

There is more or less your proc freq output. Something like this could
be tidied up and stored into a function you can use over and over again,
or another package could be used with similar functions etc.... that
will be out of the scope of this project however.

For now let's pretty that table up to showcase some of the other dplyr
verbs like select, filter, rename and arrange.

```{r, prettyitup}
pretty_output <- 
  desired_output %>% 
  # performance wise, it's often best to filter at the top, lets drop rows
  #frequency is less than 20
  filter(Frequency >= 20) %>%  #any row where that statement is TRUE, will be kept
  #lets just select the first few columns
  select(
    agegroup,
    Frequency,
    Percent
  ) %>% 
  #lets rename agegroup 
  rename(
    #format is desired name first, then original var name
    # use backticks ` for non standard names
    `Age Group` = agegroup
  ) %>% 
  #lets arrange by highest frequeny in the descending ordere
  arrange(
    desc(Frequency)
  )
  
pretty_output
```

## Question

Based on the reading above, can you use the *summarise* function, and
the dataframe: monkey_pox_state_data to tell me which is the least
common 'reportperiodend' date?

# Influenza

## Overview

Influenza data will be going live to the very tables we have been
working with in just a few days. Respiratory Syncytial Virus(RSV) will
likely follow suit, but that is more up in the air. Covid has shifted
the seasonal patterns of other respiratory diseases and now many in the
public health community are worried about the Covid, Flu and RSV coming
together to form a "tri-demic".

Using what we've learned about R, visualizations, the ODP and github
we're going to begin to put together a Rmarkdown document (like this one
here) that will contain exploratory analyses surrounding ODP data for
covid and flu that could be potentially useful to public health decision
makers. We will also attempt to incorporate signal detection methods to
see if there is any activity that might be out of the ordinary and
eventually we will take our findings and distill it down into key
takeaways that you might try to share with decision makers and
stakeholders.

### Steps

-   Review of ODP datasets for Covid-19 data (hint, there is a set of
    new tables and a set of old tables)
-   Review the ODP datasets for influenza data and any other publicly
    available data
    -   If needed, engage with ODP data stewards from the Office of
        Policy and Management they can also help us comb through all the
        data to find useful datasets
-   Construct a .rmd with possibly meaningful analyses
    -   we will code what we can, but if there is anything you've
        learned biostats that you think might be appropriate, I can work
        with you to employ those methods and fill in the 'r knowledge
        gaps'
-   TBD

## What is Meaningful?

In public health and specifically with infectious disease you'll often
be asking yourself what is a meaningful burden of disease where you can
and should take action. This can be a difficult to assess. Pretend for a
moment that you are an epidemiologist working for the Hartford Health
Department and your local health director tells you that there are 500
cases of disease X in the city and asks you if this is something we
should be monitoring.

-   What might you be prepared to say?

-   What kinds of questions are you asking yourself?

-   What kinds of questions do you have for the health director?

We discussed some of these questions on 11/30/2022 and you brought up
some great points about getting down to as granular a level as possible
in the data. You mentioned looking at the different demographics and the
zipcodes if possible. In your recent SAS project you described how you
compared different years from the YRBBS survey data. using one year as a
baseline and then comparing the counts. You also talked about how you
used visualizations to compare trends overtime. We both talked about the
severity of the disease and how that can come into play, and how certain
aspects may make data collection difficult.

These are all valid strategies and points to mull over; and you will
often combine many different tools/strategies/thought processes to pull
out signals from all the noise. One strategy I was trying to tease out
if attempted or not with the YRBBS data was if you tried any kind of
standardization. It was briefly mentioned how you looked that the YRBBS
sampling strategy to see if there was any oversampling etc... but I
really wanted to see if it was possible that you tried comparing rates.
I don't know if you had the luxury of having population denominators,
but using those to look at incidence and/or age adjusted rates are other
tools you can use to see if there are true differences between groups or
determine whether or not a jump in counts might be a due to a change in
population or is a spike in disease. If you haven't already, you will
perform a direct and/or indirect adjustment in either your stats or epi
class.

## Signal Detection -  A Covid-19 example

Let's discuss something we've alluded to many times in our previous
conversations but haven't quite covered, and that is signal detection.
This is just one take at it and is more helpful when you are counting
something with high numbers, like syndromic surveillance data. Many of
the signal detection maths are borrowed from engineering methods for
quality assurance processes. A few of which were assessed for outbreak
detection one such
[paper](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/9/19-1315_article). Methods
such as those, and others that are a little more manual/ad hoc have been
used to act quickly in public health emergencies as seen
[here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7367072/). You might
know a few of those authors :)

Using an exponentially weighted moving average (EMA or EWMA) is one such
method we have used in the past. Without getting into the details just
yet, these methods will often boil down to basically comparing a
baseline count of what was expected for a given day, based on past
information to what actually happened, and then flag days that go beyond
a certain threshold that the user sets. In engineering, a factory might
be producing many thousands of products so they have the luxury of
pulling random samples and working with their means. In public health we
often have count data and often times much smaller numbers so we have to
adjust the way we do business.

Using a statistical method to detect events of interest allows public
health workers to looks at huge swathes of data of all kinds of
different diseases and flag anything based on numbers alone. It's
repeatable and efficient and is good at casting a wide net. However, it
can lead to false positives based on what kind of data you are using,
and what kind of thresholds you are setting. Depending on the use case,
this can be acceptable if it saves time and money by preventing staff
from combing through rows and rows of raw data and it can possibly set
public health to quickly pivot and act in certain situations.

### Thought Exercise

Think about what kinds of data and/or diseases might be good fits for
using algorithmic signal detection.

-   What do they have in common?

-   How are they different?

-   Are there any data streams you came across in your mental health
    data project from the other course that might be good to use with
    algorithmic signal detection?

    -   Why are they, or aren't they a good fit?

    -   Assume for a moment you have a perfect data set, what kind of
        event might a 'mental health' signal correspond to in real life?

    -   Is this signal something public health can respond to in the
        short term or long term?

-   Pretend you have the perfect data set and you find something right
    now you can act on, think about how you want to mobilize your
    partners and stakeholders.

    -   How would you like to take advantage of this timely information
        to communicate to the public?

    -   How do approach leadership and explain to them how serious this
        situation is and what you can do to help?

## Nitty Gritty

The next few chunks of code are going to be ugly, and will need alot of
refinement, but you'll be able to get the picture if you follow along.

We're going to try this with Covid data, but then you're going to
attempt this on a novel timeseries.

```{r extra_libraries}

#install these
library(pracma) #for maths
library(roll) #for rolling mathematical functions
library(leaflet) #for mapping
library(lubridate) #package for making working with dates super easy

```

```{r lets_roll}
SMADAYS <- 7 # number of days for the simple moving average
EMADAYS <- 7# number of days for Exponentially weighted moving average
SDROLL <- 7  # number of days for the rolling Standard Deviation of errors

covid_19_epicurve <- 
  read.socrata("https://data.ct.gov/resource/g9vi-2ahj.json") %>% 
  as_tibble()


```

#### Creating a baseline and thresholds

Baselines can be complex, or simple. Sometimes it's best to pick
something you can easily explain, like a simple moving average (SMA) and
then go from there when you are explaining things to someone else.

After we make our baseline, which is just an educated guess, we want to
see how far away our *actual* values are from the guess. The magnitude
of the errors will help us determine how far away from baseline we are
and if we care.

```{r baseline}

state_counts <- 
  covid_19_epicurve %>% 
  select(date, total_cases) %>% 
  #creating SMA Prediction, it's lagged so the prediction is for the next day
  mutate(
    total_cases = as.numeric(total_cases),
    date = lubridate::as_date(date),
    baseline_SMA = lag(
      round(
        x = pracma::movavg(
          x = total_cases, 
          n = SMADAYS, 
          type = "s" #for simple moving average
        ),
        digits = 3
      )
    ),
    #residuals are prediction errors, we're going to take
    #the standard deviation of these on a rolling basis
    #setting to 0 initially
    residual_std = 0
  ) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(baseline_SMA)) %>%  #dropping NA SMA, can't make one for first day of period, but the first week of data is just 0's for everyone anyway
  mutate(residuals = total_cases - baseline_SMA) #prediction errors or residuals


#next part uses some ugly base R matrix-y stuff that the function expects
state_counts$residual_std <- 
  roll::roll_sd(
    matrix(
      state_counts$residuals
    ),
    SDROLL
  )

# we can then smooth out prediction errors using an exponentially weighted moving average, EMA or EWMA to heavily weight the more recent errors (when compared to those at the beginning of the week)
#and then we can set thresholds to see if there are spikes we care about

state_counts <- 
  state_counts %>% 
    filter(!is.na(residual_std)) %>% #dropping NA residual_std as we have that buffer and the mean just looks weird here
    mutate(
      #EMA of the SDs of the residuals
      EMA_sd = lag(
        round(
         x = movavg(
            x = residual_std, 
            n = EMADAYS, 
              type = "e" #for rolling exponential weighting
          ), 
          digits = 3
        )
      )
    ) %>% 
  #setting thresholds
  #2,3,4 have always served me well
  #any count for a given day that is 
  #the prediction + 2 thru 4 times the smooth  weight errors 
  #is an outlier we might want to look at
    mutate(
      threshold4 = baseline_SMA + (4 * EMA_sd),
      threshold3 = baseline_SMA + (3 * EMA_sd),
      threshold2 = baseline_SMA + (2 * EMA_sd)
    ) %>%
    filter(!is.na(EMA_sd))



```

#### Plotting our data, thresholds and hotspots

```{r looking_athotspots}

#this is a bit verbose, and could be cleaned up with a case_when() or two, but lets keep it simple

#I want to highlight days that shot past the expected number by our 
#3 tresholds and I want lines to show the threshold for the days

state_counts_forplot <- 
  state_counts %>% 
  mutate(
    t2highlight = if_else(
      total_cases > threshold2, 
      total_cases, 
      NA_real_
    ),
    t3highlight = if_else(
      total_cases >= threshold3, 
      total_cases, 
      NA_real_
    ),
    t4highlight = if_else(
      total_cases >= threshold4, 
      total_cases, 
      NA_real_
    ),
    t2highlight = if_else(
      !is.na(t3highlight),
      NA_real_,
      t2highlight
    ),
    t3highlight = if_else(
      !is.na(t4highlight),
      NA_real_,
      t3highlight
    )
  )


#lets take a look

ggplot(state_counts_forplot, aes(date, total_cases)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_line(aes(date, threshold4), col = "orange") +
  geom_line(aes(date, threshold3), col = "darkturquoise") +
  geom_line(aes(date, threshold2), col = "blue") +
  geom_point(aes(date, t4highlight), col = "orange", size = 1.0) +
  geom_point(aes(date, t3highlight), col = "darkturquoise", size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(aes(date, t2highlight), col = "orange", size = 2) +
  theme_dark() + 
  labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Number of Cases",
    title = "Covid-19 Confirmed and Probable Cases Hotspots"
  )
  



```

#### What do you notice?

Look at the threshold lines, what do you notice? What happens to them
during a peak, during quiet times? What does this mean for false alarms
during peaks or "off-season" times?

Look at the dots, where do they tend to congregate in relation to the
peaks, are all the does helpful? Too early or too late? Think about if
these hypothetical alarms were raised, would it buy us enough time to do
anything?

## Exercise: Back to Influenza

Since we've started this our mpox ODP table now has become a more
general table with other diseases in it. One such disease is our friend,
Influenza. Using a related table found here: [Reportable Cases on the
ODP](https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Connecticut-Reportable-Disease-Case-List/qhtt-czu2)
please pull the data down, filter to Influenza cases and practice what
we did above on this table.

You'll notice that these data are not by day, please use report period
start as your "date". Since these are already weeks we'll want to be
careful how we interpret these data. How might we want to change
EMADAYS, SDSROLL, and SMADAYS? Play around with making changes these
values and see what happens.

Add your code to a chunk below this paragraph. I want to see your data
wrangling, and a plot like the one above. Please let me know what you
find, and be prepared to answer the following:

-   Is this method appropriate for these data, why or why not?

-   And what, if any, adjustments did you have to make?

-   Is there another baseline we could've used for Flu or Covid, that
    may or may not be based on the datasets available?
